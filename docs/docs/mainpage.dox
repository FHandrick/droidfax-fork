/** 
\mainpage Dynamic Study of Android Application Programming Paradigms and their Security Implications

A plethora of research on Android have been exclusively focused on security and privacy issues in the Android software 
ecosystem, especially Android app security, yet there are very little insights into how Android applications have been
commonly built and into the environments in which those applications execute. With the proliferation of its user base
and popularity in the mobile and personal computing arena, Android apps need to be dissected and characterized with 
respect to a general understanding of their programming paradigms and runtime behaviours. Gaining such understandings
is critical as it will enable more effective development of both Android apps themselves and better security defense 
solutions for securing them.

DroidFax is a toolkit dedicated to offering an experimental framework for the dynamic characterization of Android 
apps. To help deliver a characterization more representative of the latest Android framework features, DroidFax targets 
the latest release of the Android SDK (version 6.0 / API level 23 / Marshmallow). Its core consists of a lightweight 
static analysis that mainly instruments the Dalvik bytecode of a given app for call profiling and ICC monitoring, and 
a lightweight dynamic analysis that collects and then analyzes generated call and ICC traces. It also includes a 
pre-processing phase taking charge of benchmark apps downloading and ICC-based app pairing based on the ICC resolution
results obtained using a third-party tool. The last part of DroidFax computes three categories of metrics from the 
traces: general metrics, ICC metrics, and security metrics. 

This is the project homepage for DroidFax, where you can find the usage information and downloads of source code and 
all other inputs needed by the toolkit. DroidFax is implemented on top of our Android data-flow analysis and
instrumentation library <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"><a href="https://bitbucket.org/haipeng_cai/duaf/src/d193ac3faaf0d1b76a22668170b3ccb6915be971/duafdroid/?at=master/">duafdroid</a></span>, which is based on the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"><a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/">Soot byte-code analysis and optimization framework</a></span>.
